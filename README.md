# GT IEEE Robotics: Simulator 2020
A simulator for the IEEE SoutheastCon 2020 Competition. It is to be used by the other teams to test their code before a working robot is made. Because of its design goal, this project will frequently reference the official SoutheastCon 2020 GitHub: [github.com/ncgadgetry/southeastcon2020](https://github.com/ncgadgetry/southeastcon2020).

## Directory
 * /simulator
   * Buttons - The Buttons class maintains the state of pressable buttons on the left wall
   * Field - The Field class maintains the state of the simulated elements within the field
   * Game - Maintains and coordinates the game loop
   * Utilies - Utility class to convert between units of measure
 * /test
   * TODO

## Components
This project has no functional components for now.

## To Do
* A `Util` class for unit and baisis conversions
* A `PlayField` class to model the field
* A `ButtonControl` class to model the button pushes based on the Arduino code
