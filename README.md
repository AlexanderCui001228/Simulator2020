# Simulator

Welcome to the IEEE Southeast Con 2020 Simulator, designed by the Georgia Tech IEEE Robotics Team. This readme will
explain how to use the simulator, as well as the components we've implemented.

This simulator is to be used by the other teams to test their code before a working robot is made. Because of its design goal, this project will frequently reference the official SoutheastCon 2020 GitHub: [github.com/ncgadgetry/southeastcon2020](https://github.com/ncgadgetry/southeastcon2020). It contains the rules for the competiton, as well as a model of the playing field and the Arduino code running the field's electronics.
