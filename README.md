# GT IEEE Robotics: Simulator 2020
A simulator for the IEEE SoutheastCon 2020 Competition. It is to be used by the other teams to test their code before a working robot is made. Because of its design goal, this project will frequently reference the official SoutheastCon 2020 GitHub: [github.com/ncgadgetry/southeastcon2020](https://github.com/ncgadgetry/southeastcon2020). It contains the rules for the competiton, as well as a model of the playing field and the Arduino code running the field's electronics.

## Components
This project has no functional components for now.

## To Do
* A `Util` class for unit and baisis conversions
* A `PlayField` class to model the field
* A `ButtonControl` class to model the button pushes based on the Arduino code
